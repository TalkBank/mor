1. Morphologically complex words
        1) 们 men2: it should act as suffix because its usage is constant
        2) fixed morphological patterns with reduplicated verbs, including 
                        A+不bu4+A (e.g., 对dui4不bu2对dui4==>is it correct, 会hui4不bu2会hui4==>can you do it), 
                        A + 没mei2 + A (e.g., 有you3没mei2有you3: is there any), 
                        A+A (e.g., 脚jiao3脚jiao3:foot)
                        A+A+看 (e.g., 算suan4算suan4看kan4: calculate (try it out))
